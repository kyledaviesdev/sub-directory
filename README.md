# Overview

My name is Kyle davies I am trying to establish a nice collection of repositories for future use. Ones that I could use in interviews or just for giving friends an idea of what I can do.

This is just a simple Hello World example of what I can do. But if you look closer you might find a secret that can allow for some fun.

My purpose for this specific example is just to introduce myself as well as give a bit of a peek into what I am capable of with a few minutes of time.

# Development Environment

For this I used github and git hub pages.

I used HTML for the webpage and then Javascript to allow the user to interact with the "secret" and lastly just a little bit of CSS just to make it look a little nicer.
